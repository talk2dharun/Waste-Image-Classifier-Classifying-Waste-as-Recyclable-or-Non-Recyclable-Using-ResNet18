# Waste Image Classifier

This project is a deep learning-based image classifier for waste categorization using the TrashNet dataset. The goal is to accurately classify images of trash into various categories to aid in effective waste management and environmental conservation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **TrashNet dataset**, available on Kaggle:
- License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)
- [TrashNet on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/garythung/trashnet)
- Categories include: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash.

## Project Overview

- Loads and preprocesses image data
- Constructs and compiles a convolutional neural network (CNN)
- Trains the model using the training data
- Evaluates the model's accuracy
- Makes predictions on test images

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Other standard Python libraries

## Usage

1. Download the TrashNet dataset and organize it into appropriate directories.
2. Run the Waste-Image-Classifier.ipynb notebook to train and evaluate the model.
